    <h1>Margarita Pavlova</h1>

    <p>Hi! I'm a PhD Candidate in Economics at CERGE-EI, Prague. I am an applied microeconomist specializing in Labor and Gender Economics. My research focuses on how macroeconomic conditions, labor market policies, and institutional factors shape labor market outcomes. I am particularly interested in the long-term effects of economic shocks, wage determination, and labor market inequalities.</p>

    <p>My supervisor is <a href="https://home.cerge-ei.cz/jurajda/">Stepan Jurajda</a>. In Spring 2025, I visited Department of Economics at Yale University hosted by <a href="https://sites.google.com/yale.edu/costasmeghir/home">Costas Meghir</a>.</p>

    <p>You can find my CV here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/24hru1p9s8xbu0dj5kqve/CV_Pavlova.pdf?rlkey=twbfvttwh2xlocxu211pbacbu&st=i2wprq21&dl=0">CV</a>.</p>

    <p>I am on the 2025-2026 academic job market.</p>

	  <h3>Job Market Paper</h3>
	  <ul>
	<li><strong>Graduates in a Cycle: the Effect of Business Cycle Trajectories on Labor Market Outcomes of College Graduates </strong> — <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/x0p0nir4vgc8r73astlft/JMP_Pavlova_October2025.pdf?rlkey=613w5lb07jj7s3bmaksefxjbz&st=jbb6udtv&dl=0">PDF</a>
   <p>Abstract: I re-evaluate the long-term effects of graduating from college during a recession by fo-cusing on entire business cycle trajectories, as opposed to unemployment at graduation.Using CPS data from 1976-2024, I suggest that the persistent gap in earnings between thosegraduating during high versus low unemployment chiefly corresponds to the effects ofunemployment at graduation on graduates of lower GPA, SAT scores and socio-economicbackground who enrolled in lower-tier colleges because unemployment was high at thetime of their high-school graduation. While scarring effects of graduating during a reces-sion are large and last for over a decade for these marginal graduates, the scarring effectsare smaller than previously thought and fade within three years for student cohorts en-rolling in college in a low-unemployment labor market. I also show that adverse labormarket conditions beyond the year of college graduation exert a stronger influence onlong-term outcomes of graduates than the unemployment rate at graduation. Followingunemployment trajectories and accounting for selective enrollment highlights the policy-relevant vulnerability of marginal graduates to recessions.</p>
    <h3>Working Papers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Competition and the Gender Pay Gap: Evidence from Russian Trade Withdrawal</strong> — <a href="https://www.cerge-ei.cz/pdf/wp/Wp788.pdf">PDF</a>
       <p>Abstract: In 2014, Russia imposed an import embargo on selected goods, effectively reducing trade flows and decreasing import competition across several industries. In this paper, I analyze the effect of this decrease in product market competition on the gender pay gap in Russia. This research complements the body of evidence which implies that increases in product market competition lead to lower gender pay gaps. The empirical analysis relates 2011-2019 industry-specific gender wage gaps estimated from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey to the industry-level evolution of import penetration. The results show that a 10 percentage point reduction in import competition leads to an increase of about 4 percentage points in the gender pay gap. This increase is smaller in magnitude than the effect found in the US but larger than that observed in some Eastern European countries. This phenomenon partly corresponds to an exacerbation of the gender employment gap driven primarily by high-skilled women leaving industries where import shares, and consequently competition, declined.</p>
