    <h2></h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm a PhD Candidate in Economics at CERGE-EI, Prague. I am an applied microeconomist specializing in Labor and Gender Economics. My research focuses on how macroeconomic conditions, labor market policies, and institutional factors shape labor market outcomes. I am particularly interested in the long-term effects of economic shocks, wage determination, and labor market inequalities.</p>
    <p>My supervisor is <a href="https://home.cerge-ei.cz/jurajda/">Stepan Jurajda</a>. In Spring 2025, I visited the Department of Economics at Yale University hosted by <a href="https://sites.google.com/yale.edu/costasmeghir/home">Costas Meghir</a>.</p>
    <p>You can find my CV here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/24hru1p9s8xbu0dj5kqve/CV_Pavlova.pdf?rlkey=twbfvttwh2xlocxu211pbacbu&st=i2wprq21&dl=0">CV</a>.</p>
    <p>I will be on the 2025–2026 academic job market.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
	  <h3>Job Market Paper</h3>
	  <ul>
	<li><strong>Graduates in a Cycle: the effect of business cycle trajectories on labor marlet outcomes of college graduates </strong> — draft soon!
   <p>Abstract: This paper separates the long-term effect of graduating during a recession into two
distinct components: selection into college during economic downturns and labor market
conditions after graduation. Using CPS data from 1976 - 2024, I show that individuals who
entered college during recessions are negatively selected compared to those who enrolled
in better times, and account for a larger share of the negative scarring effects typically attributed
to graduation-year conditions: while for people graduated into the recession the
effect of adverse labor market conditions disappears after 3 years, it remains for a decade
for people enrolled in college during the recession. I also find that labor market conditions
in the years immediately following graduation have a stronger impact on long-term
earnings than the unemployment rate at the time of graduation accounting for additional
2% difference in average earnings over 10 years after graduation. These findings highlight
the importance of accounting for both college-entry and early-career environments when
evaluating the impact of graduating during a recession.</p>

    <h3>Working Papers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Competition and the Gender Pay Gap: Evidence from Russian Trade Withdrawal</strong> — <a href="https://www.cerge-ei.cz/pdf/wp/Wp788.pdf">PDF</a>
       <p>Abstract: In 2014, Russia imposed an import embargo on selected goods, effectively reducing trade flows and decreasing import competition across several industries. In this paper, I analyze the effect of this decrease in product market competition on the gender pay gap in Russia. This research complements the body of evidence which implies that increases in product market competition lead to lower gender pay gaps. The empirical analysis relates 2011-2019 industry-specific gender wage gaps estimated from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey to the industry-level evolution of import penetration. The results show that a 10 percentage point reduction in import competition leads to an increase of about 4 percentage points in the gender pay gap. This increase is smaller in magnitude than the effect found in the US but larger than that observed in some Eastern European countries. This phenomenon partly corresponds to an exacerbation of the gender employment gap driven primarily by high-skilled women leaving industries where import shares, and consequently competition, declined.</p>
